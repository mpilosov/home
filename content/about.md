# Michael Pilosov, PhD
Third Generation Artist **x** Machine Learning Architect **x** Software Engineer

![portrait](./profile.jpg)

My goal is to cultivate a network of people who are working together to solve interesting and important problems.

Developing new software tools or dealing with challenging data can be major barriers to experts in any field; making something that enables reproduciblity, efficiency, and innovation requires different skillsets.
Using my technical expertise, I build bridges over those barriers, enabling others to do their very best work.


As an applied mathematician, I created a new statistical technique to reduce uncertainty when determining truth from noisy data. To share this work with anyone else who could benefit from it, I made my research accessible as open-source [software](./projects/#estimation). 
 
I now use machine learning to make data-driven decisions, predict useful information, and automate time-consuming processes. Lines of code are also my favorite media to work with when creating [beautiful things](./projects/#art).

As much as I enjoy [software engineering](./projects/#architect-engineer), I also love teaching people how to use the tools I build, and even how to build new tools on their own. I'm passionate about making complex concepts approachable to the curious-minded. 

I am also available for [consulting](./#connect) of various kinds.

My background in the following has proven useful to others:
- optimizing experiments constrained by limited resources
- training others in developing and sharing software
- migrating development teams to a cloud-native workflow
- creating and distributing Python packages (with CI/CD practices)
- making computational results reproducible and easily accessible
- creating beautiful and informative data visualizations
- using math, physics, or data to make dynamic and interactive art
