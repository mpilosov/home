I am a Third Generation Artist, Machine Learning Architect, and Scientific Software Engineer.

# I am Michael Pilosov, PhD

I enable people to answer their toughest questions by using mathematics to quanitfy and reduce uncertainty.

## I write code for people, not machines

Developing new software tools or dealing with challenging data can be major barriers to experts in any field; making something that enables reproduciblity, efficiency, and innovation requires different skillsets.
Using my technical expertise, I build bridges over those barriers, enabling others to do their very best work.



As an applied mathematician, I created a new statistical technique to reduce uncertainty when determining truth from noisy data.
To share this work with anyone else who could benefit from it, I made my research accessible as open-source [software](./projects/#estimation). 
 
I now use machine learning to make data-driven decisions, predict useful information, and automate time-consuming processes.
Lines of code are also my favorite media to work with when creating [beautiful things](./projects/#art).


## sharing knowledge is at my core

As much as I enjoy [software engineering](./projects/#architect-engineer), I also love teaching people how to use the tools I build, and even how to build new tools on their own. I'm passionate about making complex concepts approachable to the curious-minded. 

I am also available for [consulting](./#connect) of various kinds.

- optimizing experiments constrained by limited resources
- training others in developing and sharing software
- migrating development teams to a cloud-native workflow
- creating and distributing Python packages (with CI/CD + docs!)
- making computational results reproducible and easily accessible
- creating beautiful and informative data visualizations
- using math, physics, or data to make dynamic and interactive art
