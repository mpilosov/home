# Michael Pilosov, PhD
Third Generation Artist **x** Machine Learning Architect **x** Software Engineer

![portrait](./profile.jpg)

As a kid, I wanted to be one of two things: an architect, or an engineer. 

After growing up and falling in love with mathematics and computer science, I've realized I'm still able to live out both of those childhood dreams...no drafting board necessary. 

Developing new software tools or dealing with challenging data can be major barriers to experts in any field — obstructing reproducible research, efficient workflows, and innovative problem-solving. Using my technical expertise, I build bridges over those barriers, enabling others to do their very best work.

Ultimately, my goal is to cultivate a network of people who are working to solve interesting and important problems — as I help them shape the solutions.

## how i do what i do.

As an applied mathematician, I created a new statistical technique to reduce uncertainty when determining truth from noisy data. To share this work with anyone else who could benefit from it, I made my research accessible as open-source [software](./projects/#estimation). 
 
I now use machine learning to make data-driven decisions, predict useful information, and automate time-consuming processes. Lines of code are also my favorite media to work with when creating [beautiful things](./projects/#art).

As much as I enjoy [software engineering](./projects/#architect-engineer), I also love teaching people how to use the tools I build, and even how to build new tools on their own. I'm passionate about making complex concepts accessible and non-threatening to anyone who wants to learn. 

I am also available for [consulting](./#connect) of various kinds.
