# Michael Pilosov, PhD
Third Generation Artist **x** Machine Learning Architect **x** Software Engineer

![portrait](./profile.jpg)

My goal is to cultivate a network of enduring consulting relationships built around challenging problems with potential for monumental impact.

I also love building technical things for [creative purposes](./projects/#art).

## write code for people, not machines.

I am a bridge.
I quantify and reduce uncertainty by applying mathematical theory and leveraging the power of storytelling to explain complicated concepts.

I approach education and [software engineering](./projects/#architect-engineer) as art.
I enable experts to make better decisions by building them new tools for innovation and sharpening their existing ones.


As an applied mathematician, I created a new statistical technique to reduce uncertainty when determining truth from noisy data. I made my research accessible as open-source [software](./projects/#estimation).

I now use machine learning to make data-driven decisions, predict useful information, and automate time-consuming processes.

I am also available for [consulting](./#connect) of various kinds.
