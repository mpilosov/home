 # get in touch
I would love to discuss how we can work together---be that a workshop, consulting, building a software product, or something else.

Some of the things I want to work on include:
- leveraging limited data, optimizing data collection, experimental design
- implementing software best practices (testing, CI/CD, documentation)
- helping take research results or proof-of-concepts and making them production-grade, ready to share
- reproducibility of computational results, making them available online
- visualizing data, creating plots beautiful and easy to read
- making art using math, physics, data of any kind.. particularly if it's something real-time and interactive
