 # get in touch
Letâ€™s work together! 

Here are a few of my favorite things:

- optimizing limited-resource experiments
- teaching best practices for developing and sharing software
- making computational results reproducible and easily accessible
- creating beautiful and informative data visualizations
- using math, physics, or data to make dynamic and interactive art

Need me to teach a workshop, consult on projects, build a software products or something else?
