 # contact
I would love to connect with you to discuss how we can work together, be that a workshop, consulting, or building a software product.

Some areas of my expertise include:
- making the most from limited data, figuring out what to collect on a budget
- implementing software best practices (testing, CI/CD, documentation) for research code, taking proof-of-concepts and making them production-grade
- reproducibility of computational results, making them available online
- how to achieve some visual result that involves math, physics, or just general data of some kind, making plots beautiful and easy to read
