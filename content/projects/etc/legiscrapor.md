# Scraping Legislation with NLP

[Andreana Rosnik](https://andreanarosnik.com/) published her work for scraping legislation PDFs from government websites using natural language processing.
I really loved the work and use-case:
> `legiscrapor` is a project to web scrape and crawl through parliamentary websites of various countries around the world for legislation related to human rights issues.

My contribution was straightforward. I wanted stuff like this to be more easily usable by others, so I helped turn Andrea's scripts into a Python package.

I hope you can find it useful!
