# Actual Architecture

A Graphical User Interface was built to assist in the parametric design of the exterior of a new hospital wing in Denver, CO.

Six colors in varying proportions (three primary colors each with an accent) were sampled at random (with replacement) to define the visual aesthetic of the building.

It is located at the intersection of Colfax Street & Colorado Boulevard and was open to the public in Spring 2022.

The work was primarily carried out in late 2019, early 2020.

Tools used:
- `grasshopper` via Python
- `C#` for bindings to AutoCAD

In collaboration with:
- Ron Bailie
- Davis Partnership Architects
