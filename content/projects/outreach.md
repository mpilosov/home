# Stochastic Poker
{{< poker >}}

## Rules
Gambling would occur on pre-determined intervals (timer), or whenever someone wants to (if you enjoy a bit of chaos).

## History
One of the activities I organized as part of Math Club was an event where we incorporated this game as one of the “stations” at our Poker & Games night.

In a sense this was my first successful attempt at writing something that could be used without any technical background whatsoever.
