# Software Contributions
I've learned so much from free software, and want to give back by making the things I build available to others. 

I believe in making complicated things easier for people to digest, and software contributions is one way to do that.

## ML Starter-Packs
[ml-starter-packs][org] is a Github organization I created to house relatively polished projects for public consumption.

These are the tools I find myself coming back to over and over, whether for educational or development purposes.

## MTG?

## Closed Source

A bit about what I've done for work.
