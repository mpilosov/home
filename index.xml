      <description>Probably Art Start with today. Show biggest achievement.
How did we get here? Probability-Dependent Generative Artwork. It was the first experience I had with GUIs, and then the same theme tied together this project. Real-time visualization of randomness, now used to aid in design.
I want to find more projects like this.

      <description>(AKA the Monte-Carlo Calculator) talk about research, wanting to make something useful, something to share. The Oracle is a web app I built to help me make quick estimates without keeping them in my head (and then share them!).

      <description>I quantify and reduce uncertainty by applying mathematical theory and leveraging the power of storytelling to explain complicated concepts.
I am Michael Pilosov, PhD Third Generation Artist, Machine Learning Architect, &amp;amp; Scientific Software Engineer
I combine art, math, and machines to build wonderful things.
view resume  I write code for people, not machines. I am a bridge. I approach education and software engineering as art.
I enable experts to make better decisions by building them new tools for innovation and sharpening their existing ones.</description>

      <description>Software Contributions I learned so much from free software and feel the need to contribute back. When I do things now, I make them available so that people can learn from my trials and tribulations.
I believe in making complicated things easier for people to digest, and software contributions is one way I do it.
ML Starter-Packs ml-starter-packs is a Github organization I created to house relatively polished projects for public consumption.</description>
