      <description>(AKA the Monte-Carlo Calculator) The Oracle is a web app I built to help me make quick estimates without keeping them in my head (and then share them!).

      <description>I am a curious seeker of opportune moments where novel ideas spark connections to prior knowledge.
 I combine arts, maths, and machines to build wonderful things.
 I am Michael Pilosov, PhD
Machine Learning Architect &amp;amp; Engineer
What I do is reduce uncertainty through applying mathematical theory and (perhaps more importantly), with narrative and metaphor when explaining complicated concepts. I see myself as a bridge; I make technical realms more accessible to those in seek of new possibilities.</description>

      <description>ml-starter-packs is a Github organization I created to house relatively polished projects for public consumption.
