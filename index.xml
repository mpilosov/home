      <description>Probably Art I combine art, math, and machines to build wonderful things.
Start with today. Show biggest achievement.
How did we get here? Probability-Dependent Generative Artwork. It was the first experience I had with GUIs, and then the same theme tied together this project. Real-time visualization of randomness, now used to aid in design.
I want to find more projects like this.

      <description>Research MUD The Oracle (AKA the Monte-Carlo Calculator)
talk about research, wanting to make something useful, something to share. The Oracle is a web app I built to help me make quick estimates without keeping them in my head (and then share them!).

      <description>I am a Third Generation Artist, Machine Learning Architect, and Scientific Software Engineer.
I am Michael Pilosov, PhD I enable people to answer their toughest questions by using mathematics to quanitfy and reduce uncertainty.
write code for people, not machines Developing new software tools or dealing with challenging data can be major barriers to experts in any field; making something that enables reproduciblity, efficiency, and innovation requires different skillsets. Using my technical expertise, I build bridges over those barriers, enabling others to do their very best work.</description>

      <description>Software Contributions I learned so much from free software and feel the need to contribute back. When I do things now, I make them available so that people can learn from my trials and tribulations.
I believe in making complicated things easier for people to digest, and software contributions is one way I do it.
ML Starter-Packs ml-starter-packs is a Github organization I created to house relatively polished projects for public consumption.</description>
