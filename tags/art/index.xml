      <description>Probably Art I combine art, math, and machines to build wonderful things.
I have been making digital art (which occasionally becomes physical) with the use of randomness since 2013. I suppose it was a bit of a harbinger for my academic career: I wanted to explore the impact of probability distributions on some (here, visual) outcome through the use of software built and run on computers.
My art projects were actually how I learned to program, they were how I pushed the boundaries of my knowledge in both hardware and software development (it started with scripting in Matlab&amp;hellip;), and how I found a creative outlet for expression.</description>
