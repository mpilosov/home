      <description>Probably Art I combine art, math, and machines to build wonderful things.
Unfortunately, I have done a bad job of documenting these projects.
Please pardon this Work-In-Progress. I promise to fill this page with content shortly. My priority was first to document all of the other projects I&amp;rsquo;ve done.
In short, I have been making digital art (which occasionally becomes physical) with the use of randomness since 2013. I suppose it was a bit of a harbinger for my academic career: I wanted to explore the impact of probability distributions on some (here, visual) outcome through the use of software built and run on computers.</description>
